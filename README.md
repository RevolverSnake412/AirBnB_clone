# Airbnb Clone for Learning Purposes
## Description
Welcome to this Airbnb clone project! This project is created from scratch with the primary goal of facilitating the learning journey. Every aspect of building a full-fledged Airbnb-like platform will be covered, from the command interpreter to the server-side and client-side components, including storage engines and the integration of useful frameworks and APIs.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter (CI) serves as the central entry point for administrative tasks and modifications. Within the CI, you'll find a collection of powerful commands that empower you to take control of our Airbnb-inspired website. Whether you're managing listings, handling user interactions, or configuring various aspects of the platform, our command interpreter has you covered.
